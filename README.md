# Books of the Bible Puzzles

I'm to lazy to look through the text in order to find the books of the Bible so I wrote this program to do it for me. :)

## Setup:

- Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org)
- Clone this repository to a folder on your machine
- Navigater to folder in a terminal (or command prompt) window

## Run (in a terminal session):
> node index
